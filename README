This is our design document:

Running Normally:
run ServerImplementation  located in businessPlannerApp.backend
Run Main  located in businessPlannerApp

Testing Notes:
Run Backend_Test
Run Frontend_Test 

The Frontend_Test suite will fail on some cases because the testServer object isnt being reset after each test.
All tests pass when ran individually except one. The specific method (testObserver) can be rerun and it will work.
The observer pattern can also be tested manually by opening two different windows and editing the same file while both are open.
When edit history is shown it will automatically update.
